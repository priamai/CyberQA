What is SQL injection (SQLi)?,"SQL injection (SQLi) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database. This can allow an attacker to view data that they are not normally able to retrieve. This might include data that belongs to other users, or any other data that the application can access. In many cases, an attacker can modify or delete this data, causing persistent changes to the application's content or behavior. ",1,PortSwiggerNet
How to detect SQL injection vulnerabilities?," You can detect SQL injection manually using a systematic set of tests against every entry point in the application. To do this, you would typically submit:

(*) The single quote character ' and look for errors or other anomalies.
(*) Some SQL-specific syntax that evaluates to the base (original) value of the entry point, and to a different value, and look for systematic differences in the application responses.
(*) Boolean conditions such as OR 1=1 and OR 1=2, and look for differences in the application's responses.
(*)  Payloads designed to trigger time delays when executed within a SQL query, and look for differences in the time taken to respond.
(*)  OAST payloads designed to trigger an out-of-band network interaction when executed within a SQL query, and monitor any resulting interactions.",1,PortSwiggerNet
